# My experience on induction program (day-1)
• We reached the college according to the schedule for the induction program. After reaching college, we went directly to Gurudwara Sahib. The security guard inquired about the main path (or main entrance) of the Gurudwara.This indicates that a large group of people, including many children, stayed in the Gurudwara Sahib for an extended period, and the atmosphere, especially among the children, was remarkably peaceful and calm.
                                      • According to the schedule, at 10:00 AM, Langar was served. The menu included Gulab Jamun, tea and snacks and all the children ate with great happiness.
                                      • After this we all went auditorium before sitting in the auditorium our seniors give us a file bag which includes a diary, pen and Prospectus of college.
